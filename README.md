# cyclic-redundancy-check-algorithm
Cyclic redundancy check (CRC)   Unlike checksum scheme, which is based on addition, CRC is based on binary division.   In CRC, a sequence of redundant bits, called cyclic redundancy check bits, are appended to the end of data unit so that the resulting data unit becomes exactly divisible by a second, predetermined binary number.   At the destination, the incoming data unit is divided by the same number. If at this step there is no remainder, the data unit is assumed to be correct and is therefore accepted.   A remainder indicates that the data unit has been damaged in transit and therefore must be rejected.
